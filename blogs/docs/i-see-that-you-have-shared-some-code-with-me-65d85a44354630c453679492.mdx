Hello, this is Copilot. I see that you have shared some code with me. It looks like you are trying to implement pagination logic in Next.js, a popular framework for building React applications.

The logic you have implemented seems to be correct, based on the web search results I found123. You are using the useRouter and useSearchParams hooks to get and update the page number in the URL, and you are using the useEffect hook to generate an array of pagination numbers based on the total number of blogs and blogs per page. You are also using a custom component called MotionBtn to render the buttons for navigating between pages, and you are slicing the pagination numbers array to show only a few numbers around the current page.

However, there are some possible improvements you can make to your code:

You can use the getStaticProps function instead of the fetch function to get the data for your blogs at build time, which will improve the performance and SEO of your app3.
You can use the Link component from Next.js to wrap your MotionBtn components, which will enable client-side navigation and prefetching4.
You can use the useRouter query object instead of the useSearchParams hook, which will give you the same functionality but with less code5.
Here is an example of how your code could look like with these improvements:

"use client";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Link from "next/link";
import MotionBtn from "../Extended/MotionBtn";

const Pagination = ({ totalBlogs, blogsPerPage }) => {
  const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalBlogs / blogsPerPage);
  const [paginationNumbers, setPaginationNumbers] = useState([]);
  const router = useRouter();
  const { page } = router.query;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Generate an array of pagination numbers
    const numbers = Array.from({ length: totalPages }, (_, index) => index + 1);
    setPaginationNumbers(numbers);
  }, [totalPages]);

  const visiblePageNumbers = paginationNumbers.slice(
    Math.max(0, page - 3),
    Math.min(totalPages, page + 2)
  );

  return (
    <div className="mx-auto w-fit mt-10 flex gap-2">
      <Link href={`?page=${Math.max(1, page - 1)}`} passHref>
        <MotionBtn
          variant={`custom`}
          disabled={page <= 1}
          className="!p-1 !w-full !px-3"
        >
          prev
        </MotionBtn>
      </Link>
      {visiblePageNumbers[0] > 1 && <span className="px-3">...</span>}
      {visiblePageNumbers.map((number, index) => (
        <Link href={`?page=${number}`} passHref key={number}>
          <MotionBtn
            variant={`${Number(page) === Number(number) ? "primary" : "custom"}`}
            className="!p-1 !w-full !px-3"
          >
            {number}
          </MotionBtn>
        </Link>
      ))}
      {visiblePageNumbers[visiblePageNumbers.length - 1] < totalPages && (
        <span className="px-3">...</span>
      )}
      <Link href={`?page=${Math.min(totalPages, page + 1)}`} passHref>
        <MotionBtn
          variant={`custom`}
          disabled={page >= totalPages}
          className="!p-1 !w-full !px-3"
        >
          next
        </MotionBtn>
    </div>      </Link>

  );
};

export default Pagination;

I hope this helps you with your pagination logic. If you have any other questions or requests, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š
