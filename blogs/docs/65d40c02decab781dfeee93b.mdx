The mongodb _id of the data is the value of the _id field in the result object. The _id field is a unique and immutable identifier for each document in a collection, and it is automatically generated by MongoDB1. The _id field is an ObjectId, which is a 12-byte BSON type that consists of a timestamp, a machine identifier, a process id, and a counter2. You can access the _id field by using the dot notation, such as result._id. You can also use the getTimestamp() method to get the creation time of the document from the _id field3. Here is an example of how to get the mongodb _id and the timestamp of the data:

JavaScript

// Assume result is the object returned by blogData.save()
console.log("The mongodb _id of the data is: " + result._id);
console.log("The timestamp of the data is: " + result._id.getTimestamp());
