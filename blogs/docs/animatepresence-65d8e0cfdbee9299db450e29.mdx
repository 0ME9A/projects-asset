# AnimatePresence
### Animate components when they're removed from the React tree.

 AnimatePresence allows components to animate out when they're removed from the React tree.

It's required to enable exit animations because React lacks a lifecycle method that:

Notifies components when they're going to be unmounted and
Allows them to defer that unmounting until after an operation is complete (for instance an animation).

```
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion"
```
```
export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```
