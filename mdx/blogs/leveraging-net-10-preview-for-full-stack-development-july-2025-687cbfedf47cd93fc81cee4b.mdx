# Leveraging .NET 10 Preview for Full-Stack Development (July 2025)

The .NET 10 preview, released on July 7, 2025, brings stability improvements and new ASP.NET Core features, reducing runtime abstraction issues. For full-stack developers like you, this update offers a fresh tool to build cross-platform apps alongside React. Let’s explore its potential and compare it to Node.js.

## Why .NET 10 Matters

- **Stability**: Fixes runtime mismatches, enhancing reliability.
- **Performance**: Optimizes ASP.NET Core for faster APIs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Strengthens .NET’s role in modern stacks.

## Setup and Features

Install the .NET 10 preview via:
```bash
dotnet sdk install --version 10.0.0-preview.1
```
Key features include improved dependency injection and reduced memory overhead. Check the [official .NET blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) for details.

## Integrating with React

Create a .NET API and connect it to React:
- **API Setup**:
  ```csharp
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
  using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
  builder.Services.AddControllers();
  var app = builder.Build();
  app.UseRouting();
  app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
  app.Run();
  ```
- **Controller**:
  ```csharp
  [ApiController]
  [Route("api/[controller]")]
  public class DataController : ControllerBase
  {
      [HttpGet]
      public IActionResult GetData() => Ok(new { Message = "Hello from .NET 10" });
  }
  ```
- **React Fetch**:
  ```javascript
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

  function DataComponent() {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    useEffect(() => {
      fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/data")
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(setData);
    }, []);
    return <div>{data?.Message || "Loading..."}</div>;
  }
  ```
- **Explanation**: The API serves data, which React consumes dynamically.

## Comparison with Node.js

- **Performance**: .NET 10’s compiled nature often beats Node.js’s event-loop model for CPU-intensive tasks.
- **Ecosystem**: Node.js offers a vast npm ecosystem; .NET relies on NuGet but integrates well with open-source libs.
- **Use Case**: Node.js excels in real-time apps (e.g., chats); .NET 10 shines in enterprise-grade systems.

## Real-World Use: Dashboard App
Build a live dashboard where .NET 10 handles backend logic, and React renders real-time metrics. Use WebSockets for updates—see [React Hooks post](https://ome9a.com/blogs/optimizing-react-performance-with-lazy-loading-686f3e54ff8e6bd5db76c984) for frontend optimization.

## Best Practices
- **Test Early**: Use the preview’s feedback tools.
- **Hybrid Stacks**: Combine .NET with Node.js where needed.
- **Monitor**: Track performance with .NET diagnostics.

## Challenges
- **Preview Risks**: Bugs may emerge.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires adapting from Node.js workflows.

## Conclusion
The .NET 10 preview opens new doors for full-stack development with React. Explore it to enhance your projects.
